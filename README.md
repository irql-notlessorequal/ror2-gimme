# Gimme

A simple Risk of Rain 2 mod that adds a command to let you spawn in items.

## ðŸš¨ README BEFORE INSTALLING ðŸš¨

This mod intentionally disables the ability to gain achievements as it becomes REALLY easy to get them.

If you wish to get your achievements, **MAKE SURE THAT THIS MOD IS DISABLED**.

# Usage

```
/g [ITEM] [PLAYER] {QUANTITY}
/give [ITEM] [PLAYER] {QUANTITY}
```

where:
- `[ITEM]` is a single word (no spaces!!!), you can use parts of an item name like "Syringe" for "Soldier's Syringe", case insenstive
- `[PLAYER]` for a ingame player.
- `{QUANTITY}` the amount to give, integer between one and 1024, optional.
