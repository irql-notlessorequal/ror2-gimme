# Gimme

A simple Risk of Rain 2 mod that adds a command to let you spawn in items.

## ðŸš¨ README BEFORE INSTALLING ðŸš¨

This mod intentionally disables the ability to gain achievements as it becomes REALLY easy to get them.

If you wish to get your achievements, **MAKE SURE THAT THIS MOD IS DISABLED**.

# Usage

```
/gi [ITEM] [PLAYER] {QUANTITY}
/gr {ITEM} {QUANTITY}
/gimme [ITEM] [PLAYER] {QUANTITY}
/gimmerandom  {ITEM} {QUANTITY}
```

where:
- `[ITEM]` is a single word (no spaces!!!), you can use parts of an item name like "Syringe" for "Soldier's Syringe", case insenstive
- `[PLAYER]` for a player, not required when playing solo.
- `{QUANTITY}` the amount to give, a number between one and 1024, optional.

# FAQ

## Why?

funny

## Why do I see "Too much of item requested"...

Some items either make the game way too unplayable, or will lag the hell out of the host, so a very small
pool of items have a fixed limit within Gimme, you can still obtain more of these items normally through
the game.

## Why isn't this mod host only?

The achievement blocker wouldn't work then, see above.

## Can I spawn DLC items in without owning the DLC?

No.

## Can you give other players (in your lobby) items?

Yes.

This is intentional :-)
